Call up my name we found each other I held you out of the broken you give me comfort falling for you was my mistakes I brought you on top brought you one to I claimed you were so proud and openly. Wear thunder up where it turns around claimed you were so round and old bellies I follow one day you love my name I kiss you so gently I want you to stay I want you to stay I told you don't want me but why can't you wait why can't you wait till I phone I'll be all mine I said I'm feeling nothing baby but I lied. I almost got a piece of myself for life cause I was just not a piss though so you blame out your mind you're just wasting my time you're on top how put your own top. I claimed you so proud and openly baby where songs are old where songs are old. Claimed you were so proud and open. Call out my name when I kiss you so tell me go I can't you wait why can't you until I fall out I'm laughing when I kiss you so tell me go I can't do it why can't you wait till I fall out of love for some woman and when I kiss you so tell me I want you to stay I want you to stay I don't want to call out my name call out my name I kiss you so gently go I can't do it till I fall out I'm not far to move.
